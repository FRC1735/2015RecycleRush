    	// 1) Start with robot surrounding the rightmost container, facing right from DS perspective
    	// 2) Lift container
    	addSequential(new LifterGotoContainer());
    	// 3)    Drive forward enough to grab the rightmost tote 	
    	addSequential(new DriveWithLimits(3, 1.5, 0.5)); // Time, Distance, speed
    	addSequential(new LifterGotoDrop());
    	addSequential(new Delay(0.3));
    	addSequential(new LifterGoto1Tote());

    	// Now we have our container and our tote.
    	// Get everyone else's totes and one of the remaining containers
    	// 4) Turn around 180 degrees
    	addSequential(new TurnAroundCCW()); // optional args are distance, power.
    	// 5) drive forward to surround the middle tote and pick it
    	///addSequential(new DriveWithLimits(5, 4.5, 0.5)); //time, distance, speed
    	///addSequential(new LifterGotoDrop());
    	///addSequential(new LifterGoto1Tote());
    	// 6) grab the RC that is in front of us (the middle one)
    	///addParallel(new RCArmLeftUp());
    	///addSequential(new RCArmRightUp());
    	
    	// 7) Get the third tote
    	///addSequential(new DriveWithLimits(3.5, 8.85, 0.5));  // Time, Distance, speed
    	///addSequential(new LifterGotoDrop());
    	///addSequential(new LifterGotoCarryTote());
 
    	// If all goes well, we now have an RC and a 3-tote stack, with another RC on the arms.
    	// Head for the Auto Zone
		// 8) Turn 90'
    	///addSequential(new TurnInfield()); //infield is right.  Opt args distance, power
		// 9) Go forward into the Auto Zone
    	///addSequential(new DriveWithLimits(3, 8.5, 0.6666)); // Time, Distance, speed
    	// 10) Drop the RC
    	///addParallel(new RCArmLeftDown());
    	///addSequential(new RCArmRightDown());
		// 11) Drop stack
    	///addSequential(new LifterGotoDrop());
		// 12) Back up 2 feet
    	///addSequential(new DriveWithLimits(3, 2, -0.75));  // Time, Distance, speed
    	// Done.
